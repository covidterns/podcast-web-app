## General info
This project is a web version of a podcast player mimicking popular services such as Apple music or Google podcasts.
A beautiful, responsive interface and effective categorisation and sub-categorization of all the podcasts is targetted.

The standout feature of this project is a pseudo ad-filter that mutes/skips over annoying ads within podcasts. 
To achieve this, sound sampling to identify ads is approached or user submitted ad-flags/timestamps.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* React JS 
* Lorem Ipsum(Add backend)
	
## Setup
Loren ipsum blah
